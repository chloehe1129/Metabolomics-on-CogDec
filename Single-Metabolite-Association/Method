We tested the associations of metabolites with each of the neurocognitive traits using a complex survey design from the R ‘survey’ package
with a “quasi-poisson” family for a binary trait. 

This method accounts for the stratification, clustering, and probability weighting in HCHS/SOL to allow correct generalizations to the SOL-INCA 
target population. 

We used three nested regression models: 

1) adjustment for biological gender, age, study center, self-reported background 
(Dominican, Central American, Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South American, or More than one/Other heritages), 
education (less than high school, high school, or higher than high school), and years between HCHS/SOL visit 1 and the SOL-INCA visit.  

2) Model 1 further adjusted for BMI, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (estimated from serum creatinine using the CFD-EPI equation), 
Type II Diabetes (T2D) indicator, and hypertension indicator. 

3) Model 2 further adjusted for APOE ɛ4 carrier status (having at least one copy of the allele), alcohol, and cigarette consumption (never, past, current). We also performed stratified analyses by APOE ɛ4 allele carrier status. The significance threshold was False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted p-value <0.05 (q-value) computed in each analysis separately. Biological pathways for metabolites were provided by Metabolon’s annotation file.
