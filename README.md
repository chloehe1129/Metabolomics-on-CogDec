# Blood metabolites predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging

### INTRODUCTION: 
We studied metabolomics-based biomarkers predicting cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in U.S Hispanic/Latino population.
### METHODS: 
We used incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and global cognitive decline data from 1,433 diverse Hispanics/Latinos from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. We tested the association between 782 metabolites and neurocognitive traits and used Lasso penalized regression with cross-validation to select metabolites and construct a metabolomics risk score (MRS) that combines information across them to predict MCI. 
### RESULTS: 
We identified six metabolites associated with incident MCI, and eight metabolites associated with cognitive decline. The MRS had 62 metabolites and models with the 62 metabolites improved prediction accuracy of MCI from 84% to 89% in the entire dataset, and from 83% to 90% among APOE-¬ϵ4 carriers.
### What to expect here：
(1) Code for constructing metabolite risk score (MRS)
(2) Summary statistics for single-metabolite association results
