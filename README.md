### INTRODUCTION: 
We studied metabolomics-based biomarkers predicting cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in U.S Hispanic/Latino population.

### METHODS: 
We tested the association between 707 blood metabolites measured in 1,451 participants from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), with MCI and global cognitive change assessed seven years later. We further used Lasso penalized regression to construct a metabolomics risk score (MRS) that predicts MCI, potentially identifying a different set of metabolites than those discovered in individual-metabolite analysis.  

### RESULTS: 
We identified 20 metabolites associated with prevalent MCI and/or global cognitive change. Six of them were novel and 14 were previously reported as associated with neurocognitive aging outcomes. The MCI MRS comprised 61 metabolites and improved prediction accuracy from 84% (minimally adjusted model) to 89% in the entire dataset and from 75% to 87% among APOE-ε4 carriers.

### What to expect here：
(1) Code for constructing metabolite risk score (MRS)

(2) Metabolites weights useful for replicating MRS in other studies

(3) Summary statistics for single-metabolite association results organized by neurocognitive phenotypes
